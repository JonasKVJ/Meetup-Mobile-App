# Meetup-Mobile-App
Native Android Application developed at San Francisco State University, which allows for searching and displaying of Meetup.com groups based on the current location (complete project linked below). The .java files displayed in this repository are for showcasing purposes only and encompass a small part of the entire project, and are there to pinpoint my main areas of responsibility during the project. The project lasted for one semester, was built from scratch and was almost entirely remote, while including subjects such as design patterns (Singleton, Factory, MVC) and lambda expressions.
