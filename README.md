# Meetup-Mobile-App
Native Android Application developed at San Francisco State University, which allows for searching and displaying of Meetup.com groups based on the current location of the user. The project lasted for one semester, was built from scratch and was almost entirely remote, while including subjects such as design patterns (Singleton and Factory) and lambda expressions. 
Areas of the project which I had the majority/sole responsibility for include:
- Location-based construction of URL query string by using Android LocationManager
  - Most relevant file(s): JsonController.java, GPSTracker.java
- Recording of the short video titled "CSC 413 (Software Development) - CSC Project 2 Documentation", accessible at the following link: https://youtu.be/Jy_ZICNDzks

Technologies used: Android Studio, JAVA, JSON (parsing), Volley API, Meetup API, Github & Git, Netbeans, Native App Development, XML (very little)

The repository containing the complete project and official description are regrettably not accessible to anyone except the collaborators, but anything that can be used to judge the coding style of the team has been reposted here. Please keep in mind that the organization of the original project has every file organized in folders according to MVC, which this repost does not capture. 

Students involved in the project: Jonas Vinter-Jensen and Raz Hakobyan
