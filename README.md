Three minute short video demonstration of Android App: https://youtu.be/Jy_ZICNDzks

Mobile Application for Android OS developed at San Francisco State University, which uses Meetup API, JSON and Java to find and display nearby Meetup users. The .java files displayed in this repository are for showcasing purposes only and encompass a small part of the entire project, but the complete project is linked above. The project lasted for one semester, was built from scratch and was almost entirely remote, while including subjects such as design patterns (Singleton, Factory, MVC) and lambda expressions. 
Technologies used: Android Studio, JAVA, JSON (parsing), Volley API, Meetup API, Github & Git, Netbeans, Native App Development, XML (very little)

Students involved in the project: Jonas Vinter-Jensen and Raz Hakobyan
