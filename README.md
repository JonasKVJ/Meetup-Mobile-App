# Meetup-Mobile-App
Mobile Application for Android OS developed at San Francisco State University, which uses Meetup API, JSON and JAVA to find and display nearby Meetup users. The .java files displayed in this repository are for showcasing purposes only and encompass a small part of the entire project. The project lasted for one semester, was built from scratch and was almost entirely remote. 
Technologies used: Android Studio, JAVA, JSON (parsing), Volley API, Meetup API, Github & Git, Netbeans, Native App Development, XML (very little)
