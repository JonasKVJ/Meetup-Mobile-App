# Meetup-Mobile-App
Native Android Application developed at San Francisco State University, which allows for searching and displaying of Meetup.com groups based on the current location of the user. The project lasted for one semester, was built from scratch and was almost entirely remote, while including subjects such as design patterns (Singleton and Factory) and lambda expressions. 

## Main Responsibilities
- Location-based construction of URL query string by using Android LocationManager
  - Relevant files: JsonController.java, GPSTracker.java
- Recording of the short video titled "CSC 413 (Software Development) - CSC Project 2 Documentation", accessible at the following link: https://youtu.be/Jy_ZICNDzks

As the majority of my coding  was focused on location tracking, only that code has been reposted, but other small areas of responsibility include setting up simple accessors and mutators, or discussing with the other team member how solve an issue. Please keep in mind that the organization of the original project has every file organized in folders according to MVC, which this repost does not capture.

## Technologies 
Android Studio, JAVA, JSON (parsing), Volley API, Meetup API, Github & Git, Netbeans, Native App Development, XML (very little)
